<h1>TryHackMe Walkthrough - Anonforce</h1>

<h3>PGP? GPG? PGGPPGG?</h3>

<p>12/01/2021</p>

<p>Now that I have some time off of university, I thought I’d try and get some old TryHackMe rooms done. I decided to start off easy and work my way up, so lets give “Anonforce” a go!</p>

<h2>Enumeration</h2>

<p>I started off a with nice and easy nmap scan. I scanned all the ports (just in case) and threw the “-sV” flag on there for good measure. The scan didn’t take too long but it wasn’t incredibly exciting.</p>

<p><code>
PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION <br />
21/tcp open ftp vsftpd 3.0.3 <br />
22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) <br />
Service Info: OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux\_kernel
</code></p>

<h2>User Flag</h2>

<p>Lets give the FTP server a shot. I tried connecting to it using user anonymous and password anonymous, and it worked a treat!  </p>

<p><code>
ftp 10.10.42.70 <br />
Connected to 10.10.42.70. <br />
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3) <br />
Name (10.10.42.70:chris): anonymous <br />
331 Please specify the password. <br />
Password: <br />
230 Login successful. <br />
Remote system type is UNIX. <br />
Using binary mode to transfer files. <br />
ftp&gt;
</code></p>

<p>From here, I moved into the home directory and found the home folder of the user “melodias”. Moving into that directory, I found the user flag! I use the “get” command to download it and opened it up on my local machine! Easy peasy! One flag down, one to go!</p>

<h2>Root Flag</h2>

<p>Now for the root flag. After snooping around for a bit I noticed a folder in the root directory called “notread”.</p>

<p><code>
ftp&gt; ls <br />
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV. <br />

</code></p>

<p>Out of respect, I didn’t look into the folder any further. <br />
Just kidding! <br />
Moving into it I found two files – “backup.pgp” and “private.asc”. I won’t lie, I didn't know the first thing about PGP or GPG so I had to do some research here. It turns out, we should be able to view the contents of “backup.pgp” using the “private.asc” file as a key! Good stuff! I downloaded both file onto my machine. I started by trying to add the “private.asc” to my key bank using the command:</p>

<p><code>
gpg --import private.asc
</code></p>

<p>I was then prompted for a password. I don’t know the password so lets crack it! Using “gpg2john”, a tool that comes with John the Ripper, I was able to turn "private.asc" into a file that john could crack!</p>

<p><code>
gpg2john private.asc &gt; key
</code></p>

<p>Then I ran john against my new "key" file. What would you know, it cracked it almost instantly! I used the "--show" flag to view the password.</p>

<p><code>
john key john key --show
</code></p>

<p>I could then run the import command again and use the new found password to import the key! Awesome! Now we use GPG to decrypt our other file!</p>

<p><code>
gpg --decrypt backup.pgp
</code></p>

<p>This outputted what seemed to be a copy of the “shadow” file from the server, containing a hash of the root password! This should be simple enough to crack! I move the hash into a file called "root.hash", and using hashcat and the rockyou.txt wordlist, made quick work of it!</p>

<p><code>
hashcat -a 0 -m 1800 root.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
</code></p>

<p>After a few moments I had the root password! I could use this password to SSH as root onto the server and grab the flag!</p>

<p><code>
ssh root@IP cat root.txt
</code></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall this room was quite straightforward! The only challenge I had was with the PGP/GPG keys as I’ve never used them before! If you’re familiar with them I think you’d breeze through this room no problem!</p>
