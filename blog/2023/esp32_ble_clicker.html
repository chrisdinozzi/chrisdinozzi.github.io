    <h1>ESP32-S3 BLE Clicker</h1>

    <h3>A simple BLE remote clicker using the Adafruit ESP32-S3.</h3>

    <p>09/09/2023</p>
    <p>I really want to buy a <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero</a>. If you are unaware, a Flipper Zero is a compact hacking tool that gives you access to an array of attacks at your fingertips - from Bad USB to NFC to Infrared, it can do a lot. The thing that really peaked my interest, however, was the additional <a href="https://www.joom.com/geek/en/products/631b4ab0a74fe601db26998a">ESP32 board</a> you could purchase to extend the functionality of the device into the realm of wireless fidelity.</p>
    <p>However, once I put the Flipper Zero and WiFi dev board into my basket and went to check out, the price compelled me to close the tab and reevaluate my needs. Instead, I decided to take the slightly more DIY approach to delving into the realm of ESP32 and the joy it can bring.</p>
    <p>I picked up an ESP32-S3 device from Adafruits. It's a compact little thing with a built in 240x135 TFT display, 3 programmable buttons, a battery monitoring chip, NeoPixel LED, and a whole load more. This was appealing as an alternative to the Flipper Zero since it already had the display, inputs, and battery functionality built into the same board as the ESP32 chip.</p>
