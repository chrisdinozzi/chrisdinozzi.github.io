        <h2>/about/</h2>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Abertay in 2022 with a First in Ethical Hacking. My studies covered a number of topics including system/webapp penetration testing, digital forensics, programming, networking, and cloud computing.</p>
        <p>While studying, I worked on and off, part time for Wood in their security operations team.</p>
        <p>I know work at SSEN Transmission in the OT Testing team.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy exercising and photography, as well as spending time with my family playing games or drinking coffee.</p>
