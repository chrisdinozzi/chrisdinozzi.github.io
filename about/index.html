        <h2>/about/</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Abertay University with a First after completing their Ethical Hacking degree (2018-2022). During that time I worked on and off as a Business Information Security Analyst. I earned my Comptia Security+ certification in February 2022.</p>
        <p>My current job is mainly OT systems and application support (ADMS/Data Historian + a lot of Windows 10 stuff ATM) but I continue to do security stuff at work (risk, system security, automatic monitoring) and in my free time.</p>
        <p>Outside of computers I enjoy photography (digital and film) as well as spending time with my wife playing games or doing puzzles.</p>
